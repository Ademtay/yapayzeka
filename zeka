requirements.txt: Contains all necessary Python packages for AI development
README.md: Detailed documentation about the project structure and usage
notebooks/01_basic_ai_examples.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook with basic AI examples
src/utils/preprocessing.py: A utility module for data preprocessing
The project includes:
Machine learning and deep learning capabilities
Data preprocessing tools
Example notebooks
A well-organized project structure
To get started with the project:
First, install the required packages:
Start Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to the notebooks folder and open 01_basic_ai_examples.ipynb to see some basic AI examples.
The project is set up to be extensible, so you can:
Add your own models in the src/models directory
Create new notebooks for different AI applications
Add your datasets in the data directory
Use the preprocessing utilities for your data
